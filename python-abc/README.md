# Inheritance
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about inheritance, superclass, baseclass and subclass in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.5
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `task_00_abc.py` |  Create a subclass named `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class.-Implement the `sound` method in the `Dog` class to return the string "Bark".Create a subclass named `Cat` that also inherits from the `Animal` class.
Implement the `sound` method in the `Cat` class to return the string "Meow".|
| `task_01_duck_typing.py` | Class `Circle` that inhertis from `Shape` |
| `task_02_verboselist.py` | Class `VerboseList` that inherits from the built-in `list` class. |
| `task_03_countediterator.py` | Class named `CountedIterator` that extends the built-in iterator obtained from the `iter` function |
| `task_04_flyingfish.py` | Class Fish  with methods swim (which prints "The fish is swimming") and habitat (which prints "The fish lives in water").
And Create a `Bird` class with methods `fly` (which prints "The bird is flying") and `habitat` (which prints "The bird lives in the sky") |
| `task_05_dragon.py` | Design two mixin classes, `SwimMixin and` And `FlyMixin`, each equipped with methods `swim` and `fly` respectively. Next, construct a class `Dragon` that inherits from both these mixins. Your aim is to show that a `Dragon` instance can both swim and fly. |
